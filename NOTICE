CCWS Banner Web Component
Copyright (c) 2025

This project includes the ccws-banner JavaScript component and multiple levels
of default configuration intended to allow the banner to function on any site
without requiring custom setup.

The configuration system operates in the following order:

1. Site-Provided Configuration  
   Implementers may host their own configuration file
   (e.g., /ccws-banner.config.js, /config/ccws-banner.config.js,
   or /assets/config/ccws-banner.config.js), or they may define a global
   window.CCWSBannerConfig object. These site-specific configuration files
   are owned and controlled by the implementer and are not part of this
   project's distribution.

2. Repo-Provided Default Configuration  
   This repository includes a default configuration file
   (ccws-banner.config.js) intended as a shared fallback when no
   site-specific configuration is available. This file is distributed as part
   of the project and demonstrates the available configuration options.

3. Embedded Internal Defaults  
   The ccws-banner.js script contains an internal hardcoded configuration
   object used as a final fallback. These embedded defaults exist solely to
   guarantee that the component remains functional even if all external
   configuration files fail to load.

All three configuration layers contain non-sensitive display preferences
such as API URLs, banner text, colors, fonts, season start/end dates, and
timing settings.

The banner retrieves publicly accessible JSON data from an external website
operated by Community Partnership of the Ozarks (CPO):  
https://ccws.cpozarks.org

All rights to the external data, website content, branding, and presentation
remain solely with their respective owners. This project does not claim any
ownership, endorsement, affiliation, or partnership with CPO or its programs.

The banner may attempt to display the external website in an HTML <iframe>.
Whether this is allowed depends entirely on the external site's technical
and policy settings, including X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy.
If framing is disallowed, the banner automatically falls back to opening the
site in a new tab for user safety and accessibility.
